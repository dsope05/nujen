  "autobiography": "Hi everyone! My name is Maricris Bonzo and I'm the Founder and Head of Community at Women in Web3. I helped build a non-profit called GarageScript back in 2017 that taught AND paid people to code and helped them land jobs through peer-to-peer learning. I later went on to start a Youtube channel where I taught people how to code in Vim, how to learn JavaScript and how to integrate with cool APIs that I found on Hacker News. With my artistic and techie background, I soon became a Developer Advocate for various companies - where I built and deployed lots of full-fledged sample apps with supporting blogs, video tutorials or conf. talks to guide other devs on how to build them. As you can see, I'm what you can call a Multi-Passionate Creative. I love to code, create content and build communities. Super happy to be able to do all 3 in this wonderful space of web3. Currently, I'm OBSESSED with community building in DAOs, and gathering meaningfully. My dream is to launch the Women in Web3 DAO so that women, esp. underrepresented women, can have a fun and sustainable way to build their dream job in web3 (something I'm currently trying to achieve with Women in Web3 - meta, right?). If you ever want to chat with me about Developer Relations, Community Building, or being a Founder in web3, pls feel free to book here: https://calendar.app.google/ZFk7NLN7ygaNe7Wy5. I'm also super active on Twitter: https://twitter.com/seemcat.",

  "writingSample": "Guess what? It has officially been one month since I experienced my very first severe anxiety attack üôÉ. Because I‚Äôve never really felt anxiety in my life - that is, until I started going HAM at the startup I worked for, I knew it was a serious warning sign. My body, mind & soul was done with that hustle life.  And so, I left my decent paying job to go full-time into web3 and carve my own, more balanced career path üëè.  One might ask, ‚ÄúDo you regret leaving during the worst bear market of the year?‚Äù My answer is nah. I don‚Äôt regret finally prioritizing my mental and emotional well-being.  Besides, I went on to have the most fun time ever being a full-time, Multi-Passionate Entrepreneur in web3. In as little as 4 1/2 weeks, I was able to do the following:  Attend Permissionless & met incredible ppl in web3 like Bux and Coopahtroopa Was accepted to become a Blu3 DAO Scholar (thanks to Harmony & Storj) Participated & won bounties for Activate x Wormhole hackathon Gave a talk on Crypto Wallets for Get Money Get Paid 2022 Conference Connected with amazing Founders of communities for women (Cami, Maggie, Deana, Alejandra, & Novell) Attended Graph Day & finally met Kevin Owocki IRL Participated in Graph Hack & won 1st place of the Coinbase bounty Pitched the WOMEN IN WEB3 Grant at the GR14 DEI Pitch Session  While it has been a crazy past few weeks, all of the traveling and hard work has been worth it. Because I finally pursued my dream of going full-time into web3, instead of feeling dread or anxiety, I‚Äôve been enjoying life even more ü•∫."
