  "writingSample": "Guess what? It has officially been one month since I experienced my very first severe anxiety attack üôÉ. Because I‚Äôve never really felt anxiety in my life - that is, until I started going HAM at the startup I worked for, I knew it was a serious warning sign. My body, mind & soul was done with that hustle life.  And so, I left my decent paying job to go full-time into web3 and carve my own, more balanced career path üëè.  One might ask, ‚ÄúDo you regret leaving during the worst bear market of the year?‚Äù My answer is nah. I don‚Äôt regret finally prioritizing my mental and emotional well-being.  Besides, I went on to have the most fun time ever being a full-time, Multi-Passionate Entrepreneur in web3. In as little as 4 1/2 weeks, I was able to do the following:  Attend Permissionless & met incredible ppl in web3 like Bux and Coopahtroopa Was accepted to become a Blu3 DAO Scholar (thanks to Harmony & Storj) Participated & won bounties for Activate x Wormhole hackathon Gave a talk on Crypto Wallets for Get Money Get Paid 2022 Conference Connected with amazing Founders of communities for women (Cami, Maggie, Deana, Alejandra, & Novell) Attended Graph Day & finally met Kevin Owocki IRL Participated in Graph Hack & won 1st place of the Coinbase bounty Pitched the WOMEN IN WEB3 Grant at the GR14 DEI Pitch Session  While it has been a crazy past few weeks, all of the traveling and hard work has been worth it. Because I finally pursued my dream of going full-time into web3, instead of feeling dread or anxiety, I‚Äôve been enjoying life even more ü•∫."
